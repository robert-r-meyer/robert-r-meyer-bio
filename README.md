# Robert R. Meyer

I am a veteran of 10 years in the Chicago start-up space and a polyglot to boot.
During this time I provided technological guidance and drove business
delivery goals. Working on small teams helped to hone my communication skills and
provided time to realize that technology is only as useful as its its application.

In my time not impersonating a turning complete compiler, I am a licensed
skydiver, scuba diver, and have a love of motorcycles that is starting to
become a bit of an issue in garage space. During the winter snowboarding
is my distraction of choice. In order to distract myself otherwise, I
brew beer on the weekends.
