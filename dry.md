Soren is the lead developer of MedArrive.  He has been the founder or primary developer for several startups in the mobile healthcare space, and has experience with many different aspects of early-stage product development.  Soren previously built a high-volume email sending platform for a small startup called RestEngine, which was eventually acquired by Twitter.  After several years working there, he returned to the startup space, and founded VetPronto, an in-home pet healthcare company.  The company was a part of the Winter 2015 batch at YCombinator, and expanded to several states before eventually merging with a similar company called Vetted.  Between the two, Soren has spent the last 5 years building platforms for mobile healthcare, and will use that expertise to take MedArrive from concept to MVP and beyond.  Soren graduated with a computer science degree from Grinnell College.
