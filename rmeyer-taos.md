# Robert R. Meyer

I am a slacker currently acting as a pod lead due to the magic of
[programmatic reflection.](https://www.journaldev.com/1789/java-reflection-example-tutorial)
This allows me to take on the properties of my pod mates and use their skills in order to appear
as a master of all things.

I started my journey towards horrible programming practices in 4th grade when my fathers 486x66 DOS
menu was terrible. After getting grounded for reprogramming the computer I was hooked. As the time I
I spent the world of reserved keywords grew longer, I grabbed a CS degree in an attempt to not have to
look for a job during the rescission and post dot-com bubble. The dip took longer to recover
then I had planned so timing dictated that graduation should be delayed by the pursuit of a minor in
sociology. This granted me the ability to distinguish why people did horrible things both in
the real world and in their commits to projects.

After spending ten plus years in the Chicago start-up scene, a long motorcycle trip ended with me
relocating to Boise. Here I became a member of the smoke jumpers team that Taos deploys when initial
encounters render the engagement plan null and void. As a programmer I realize that null and void
are often synonymous and thus attempt to remove the redundant code.

Time spent in this reaction team demonstrated how a core team of people with a singular goal in mind
could improve the ecosystem for all users. This lead to the creation of the Dev Ops Now group.
With the members of this team, we still act as the first responders when something goes terribly
wrong, but we also strive to prevent widespread destruction and disruption due to the manual workings around
both development and operations.

In my time not impersonating a turning complete compiler, I am a licenced skydiver, scuba diver,
and have a love of motorcycles that is starting to become a bit of an issue in garage space. During
the winter snowboarding is my distraction of choice.
